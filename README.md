# OWASP SQL Injection Demonstration

This repository contains two educational projects demonstrating SQL injection vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🔓 Insecure Project
**Location:** `/insecure-project`

A deliberately vulnerable web application demonstrating common SQL injection vulnerabilities. This project shows:
- Authentication bypass through SQL injection
- Data extraction via UNION-based injection
- How attackers can exploit poor coding practices

⚠️ **WARNING:** This code is intentionally insecure for educational purposes only. Never use in production!

### 2. 🔒 Secure Project
**Location:** `/secure-project`

A properly secured web application demonstrating best practices for preventing SQL injection. This project shows:
- Parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Secure error handling

✓ **SAFE:** This code demonstrates security best practices and can be used as a reference for production applications.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- **Learning**: Understand how SQL injection works and why it's dangerous
- **Education**: See real examples of vulnerable vs. secure code
- **Training**: Practice identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of insecure and secure implementations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm

### Running the Insecure Project
```bash
cd insecure-project
npm install
npm run init-db
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

### Running the Secure Project
```bash
cd secure-project
npm install
npm run init-db
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3001

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### SQL Injection Attacks
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Login without knowing passwords
2. **Data Extraction**: Retrieve sensitive information from the database
3. **Query Manipulation**: Modify SQL queries to perform unintended actions

### Defense Techniques
1. **Parameterized Queries**: Using placeholders instead of string concatenation
2. **Input Validation**: Ensuring data meets expected formats
3. **Input Sanitization**: Removing dangerous characters
4. **Password Hashing**: Protecting passwords with bcrypt
5. **Error Handling**: Preventing information leakage

## 🔍 Comparison

| Aspect | Insecure Project | Secure Project |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| SQL Queries | String concatenation | Parameterized queries |
| Password Storage | Plain text | Bcrypt hashed |
| Input Validation | None | Strict validation |
| Error Messages | Detailed (leaks info) | Generic (safe) |
| Security Level | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Protected |
| Port | 3000 | 3001 |

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Both projects include built-in examples of:
- Valid login credentials
- SQL injection payloads
- Search queries (both safe and malicious)

The insecure project will demonstrate how attacks work, while the secure project will show how proper defenses prevent them.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The insecure project is intentionally vulnerable and should **NEVER** be deployed to production or any environment accessible from the internet. It is strictly for educational purposes in controlled environments.

Both projects are simplified demonstrations focusing on SQL injection and XSS prevention. Production applications require additional security measures such as:
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- CSRF protection
- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Session management
- Account lockout policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Regular security audits
